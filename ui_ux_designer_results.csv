Senior UI/UX Designer,25-Jan-23,"<p><strong><u>About the role</u></strong></p><p>Your job is to dictate the users’ experience when they engage on the client’s product, whether it’s an app or a website. It’s one of the most important roles in a project because no matter how brilliantly your engineering colleagues have built the tech if it looks and feel like a lemon, the users will think it’s a lemon. Essentially, if you screw up, we’re screwed. Big responsibility? Hell, yeah!</p><p>On the flip side, you get to work on projects that are high profile, impactful and that will be in the hands of the masses. You can tell that date or crush you have “Hey, you know that app you use every day? Yeah, I’d designed it” and watch their jaws drop and swoon (if you did your job properly, of course).</p><p>So... you’ll be liaising with clients and understanding their objectives and requirements, guiding and correcting them as and when necessary (politely, of course), understanding how users behave, designing the users’ experience that is intuitive and making sure that the end results at least meet but preferably, surpass the clients and end users’ expectations.</p><p>Ideally, you should have experience in the field. We won’t judge you based on your years of experience but rather, on the quality of your previous work. Additionally, if you’ve only had 12 months of experience versus the other candidate who’s had 12 years, but your work kicked ass while the other candidate’s work was ho-hum? Well... YOU’RE HIRED!</p><p>What you get to do:</p><ul><li>Analyse technology trends, customer responses and data to determine what appeals to our customers.</li><li>Improve the application’s user interface to enhance the end users’ experience.</li><li>Collaborate with Product Owners and Engineers to design strong overall concepts for the user experience of the respective platforms, for both mobile and web, ensuring easy and intuitive user journeys.</li><li>Critical thinking and problem-solving abilities to ensure that shit gets done and done well.</li><li>Design the UI/UX for both mobile and web applications.</li><li>Understanding of layout aesthetics.</li><li>Participate in discussions, designing and testing all UI/UX mock-ups and prototypes that illustrate clearly how sites function and look.</li><li>Identify areas for growth and improvement.</li></ul><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li>Attitude and character are more important than experience and skills. We are looking for someone who is structured, well organised, has great attention to detail, is trustworthy and diligent and is a good team player.</li><li>Ability to multi-task and prioritise work efficiently even under pressure.</li><li>A passionate interest in the future of web and mobile technology.</li><li>Ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with people at all levels across the organisation and externally.</li><li>Possess at least Bachelor's Degree, Post Graduate Diploma, Professional Degree, Art/Design/Creative Multimedia, Advertising/Media or equivalent. However, if you don’t and you’re self-taught, that would impress us more.</li><li>At least 4 years of working experience in IT industry.</li><li>Would be great if you have the following skill(s): Knowledge in UI/UX, Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator / In-Design / After Effect / Sketches / Photography / Videography.</li><li>Added advantage if you can develop web responsive design into a working template (Bootstrap, JQuery, HTML, CSS and JavaScript).</li><li>Strong knowledge in Creative Design with creative ideation and conceptualization.</li><li>A good team player and receptive to amendments.</li><li>Good time management skills and ability to meet deadlines without sacrificing quality.</li><li>Positive working attitude with a willingness to learn and adapt</li><li>Preferred Languages for written and spoken are English and Bahasa Melayu.</li><li>Good computer skills including MS Office &amp; Excel.</li><li>Foreigners are welcome to apply.</li></ul><p>Company Benefits:</p><ul><li>Flexible working hours Mon - Friday</li></ul>",https://www.jobstreet.com.my/en/job/senior-ui-ux-designer-5241310
